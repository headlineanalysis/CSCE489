       <h2>Overview and Motivation:</h2>
      <p>Every day we're greeted with new stories in the news, but how have the headlines themselves changed over time? 
        We set out to uncover trends in the way that headlines are written to better understand the effects of war, 
        technology and (....) on our news. </p>
      <h2>Related Work:</h2>
      <p> Will Fill in Later<p>
      
      <h2>Initial Questions:</h2>
      <p>Some of the initial questions that we asked are:  Are the headlines become harder or easier to read? 
        In what time period do the headlines have the most question marks?  In what time period are the  headlines changing 
        from all Caps to lowercase ? Are the people in the 2nd industrial revolution readability score becoming higher or is 
        there any relation?<p>
      <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
      <h3>Data Collecting and Processing</h3>
      <p>We used various visualizations to represent our findings. Some include line graphs, scatter plots, and color maps.
        These various plots where useful when trying to answer our questions. We did had to scrape a lot of data from the New York API
        and clean and store in a csv. Then eventually  we  have all that data. <p>
