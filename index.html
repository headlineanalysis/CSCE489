       <h2>Overview and Motivation:</h2>
      <p>Every day we're greeted with new stories in the news, but how have the headlines themselves changed over time?
        We set out to uncover trends in the way that headlines are written to better understand the effects of war, 
        technology and (....) on our news. We wanted to find interesting trends in the headlines over the time, and see 
        what factors might be responsible for the variations.

      <h2>Initial Questions:</h2>
      <p>Some of the initial questions that we asked are:  Are the headlines become harder or easier to read? 
        In what time period do the headlines have the most question marks?  In what time period are the  headlines changing 
        from all Caps to lowercase ? Are the people in the 2nd industrial revolution readability score becoming higher or is 
        there any relation?<p>
      <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
      <p>We used various visualizations to represent our findings. Some include line graphs, scatter plots, and color map feature. 
      These plots were useful to visualize the answers to our questions. We used New York Times API to collect headlines from news
      articles. We collected around 13 million articles, ranging from the year 1882-2016, to show our analysis of headlines in the
      news articles over the time period. Since our analysis has been conducted on a large dataset, 
      we kept our visuals simple, so it is easier for someone to understand the analysis.<p>
      
      <h2>Final Analysis!</h2>
        
        <h3>The '?' Analysis:</h3>
          <p>Clickbait headlines are slowly becoming norm for headlines. They are used to get clicks with nothing more than just 
            a creative way of spinning what could be a mundane topic. The ‘?’ at the end of the headlines prompt the user to click them,
            and find out the content. We were interested in finding how the use of ‘?’ has changed 
            in the headlines over the time.<p>
